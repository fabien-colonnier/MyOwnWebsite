<h1> Concept genesis </h1>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The project was initiated in 2008 by the student association <i>ITD</i>, which had for objectives to explore new concept for the future of mobility. I have been a member of this association from 2008 to 2012, where I have been successively, secretary, treasurer and president. 
Everything started with a design contest in the engineering school ESTACA where to objective was to create the car of 2020. The winning project would have its vehicle built as a concept car.
</p>

The winner was Nicolas Meunier with its car named Emma:

</div>
<br/>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
His concept was inspired by the Peel P50, the smallest car in the world according to Top Gear (<a href="https://youtu.be/dJfSS0ZXYdo"> youtube link</a>). It was designed to be an electric urban car. It won the contest as it was innovative idea and was a great challenge from an engineering point of view. 
As a reminder, the Renault Twizy was not out and its conception had not even started as well.

The objective was then for us to build this vehicle with the aim to be as close as possible as what the real vehicle could be. Sure some limitations due to the limited ressources at our disposal were obvious. But we intended to build a functional vehicle, the closest as possible to a commercialized one.
</p>

<h1> Engineering conception </h1>


<h1> Frame welding </h1>

<h3> Main frame </h3>

From the CAD design, we cut, bent and weld tubes to realize the frame. 

TODO: need to put more pictures of the frame welding

<h3> Swing arm </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The idea was integrate all the powertrain the closest to the rear wheel to provide as much space in the vehicle as possible.
We finally chose to put everything on the swing arm as it was the easiest from a vehicle architecture point of view. It had also the advantage of reducing the complexity for the chain setup and maintenance. Although from a vehicle dynamics point of view, it is obviously not the right choice given the amount of unsuspended mass. But it was a compromise we accepted for a concept car.
Therefore, the swing arm was designed to receive the electric motor, the CVT and the gear reducer.

<h1> Body creation </h1>

<h3> Creation of the Master </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The bodywork started with the installation of wooden boxes, fixed to the the frame. The idea was to creatte the boday around the frame to be sure it will fit. Indeed, it was possible to check the suspension wheel course and make sure any body parts were in the way.

</ul>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
Second phase of the master's creation was to cut layers of foam according to body sections. First, the sections, previously prepared on CAD, were printed on paper and cut. They were then drawn on a first layer of foam. Then, each layer were doubled to get the symetrical section at each cut. A rough section cutting was made with a band saw and finished precisely with a lathe-mounted disk sander.
As it was chosen to build the master around the frame to make sure that it will fit in the end, a long session of adjustment of the sections were made manually to allow them to fit onto the wooden boxes. Then, a first squeezing of the section was made to make sure evyrthing fits and being able to mark the position of the sections on the wood. Then, one by one were glued on the wooden boxes with putty. In this phase, a setting plate was made to provide a reference for the curve of the body. It was useful to make sure the sections are well placed and also to have a reference later during the sanding.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
Third phase consists in the sanding of the foam, to create the final shape of the body. The blue and black paint are here to highlight the part to sand, as the two neighboring sections should be continuous.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
After the shape of the body was finalized, a layer of glass fiber was applied on the foam. The objective was to have a robust master to create the mold of the body. A copy of the windshield in resin was also made to avoid modeling this part in the foam. 
First, putty has been applied on the section's junctions to make sure that they are not seen on the master. Then, glassfiber layers were cutted and placed on the different surfaces of the vehicule. The resin was applied and debubblizer was used to remove any potential air bubbles. The resin application should be fast to have a uniform thickness.
