.. title: Sections' preparation: cutting and collage on the frame

Second phase of the master's creation, foam sections cutting and collage on the frame. The gallery recaps all the steps of this phase. It was longer than expected. Indeed, it was chosen to build the master around the frame to make sure that it will fit in the end. This choice has for consequence to make the adaptation of the sections on the body very slow.
