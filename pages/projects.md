This page describes some of my personal projects I could have done. For now, only my main realization is described. 

<h1> Emma: an urban electric vehicle</h1>

This project was developed during my student time with the help of Valentin Magnier and many others.

<h3> Concept genesis </h3>

The project was initiated in 2008 by the student association <i>ITD</i>, which had for objectives to explore new concept for the future of mobility. Everything started with a design contest in the engineering school ESTACA. The winning project would have its vehicle built as a concept car.

The winner was Nicolas Meunier with its car named Emma:

</div>
<br/>
His concept was inspired by the Peel P50, the smallest car in the world according to Top Gear (<a href="https://youtu.be/dJfSS0ZXYdo"> youtube link</a>). It was designed to be an electric urban car. It won the contest as it was innovative idea and was a great challenge from an engineering point of view. 
As a reminder, the Renault Twizy was not out and its conception had not even started as well.

The objective was then for us to build this vehicle with the aim to be as close as possible as what the real vehicle could be. Sure some limitations due to the limited ressources at our disposal were obvious. But we intended to build a functional vehicle, the closest as possible to a commercialized one.

<h3> Engineering conception </h3>


<h3> Frame welding </h3>


<h3> Bodywork creation </h3>

The bodywork started with the installation of wooden boxes, fixed to the the frame. The idea was to creatte the boday around the frame to be sure it will fit. Indeed, it was possible to check the suspension wheel course and make sure any body parts were in the way.

	<a href="/galleries/Bodywork/DSCF0043.JPG" class="thumbnail image-reference" title="Dscf0043">
            <img src="/galleries/Bodywork/DSCF0043.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Dscf0043"></a>
	<a href="/galleries/Bodywork/DSCF0029.JPG" class="thumbnail image-reference" title="Dscf0029">
            <img src="/galleries/Bodywork/DSCF0029.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Dscf0029"></a>
</div>

Second step was to cut layers of foam according to body sections.

TODO put second gallery.
