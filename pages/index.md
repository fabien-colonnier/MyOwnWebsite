		<b>Short bio:</b>
		I received a MSc in automotive engineering with a speciality in embedded systems from the ESTACA engineering school in 2012 and a PhD degree in bio-robotics from the Aix-Marseille University in 2017, both in France. My research is focused on visual perception for robotic applications. I am looking at bio-inspired solutions to achieve efficient localization and navigation using event-based sensors, neuromorphic computation and artificial compound eyes.
